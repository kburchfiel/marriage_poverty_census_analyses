    "# Marriage & Poverty Census Data Analyses (Work in Progress)\n",

    "This script will import Census data that will help answer two questions: \n",
    "1. Are married couples are less likely to live below the poverty line than non-married couples?\n",
    "2. Do married couples with kids have a lower poverty rate than do non-married households with kids?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: (Although Census data can help us determine the relative poverty rates between married and non-married households, it can't answer the more important question: does getting married actually *reduce* poverty? After all, it's possible that the causal path between marriage and poverty may run in reverse: individuals who are better off financially might be more likely to marry. In other words, poverty might reduce the marriage rate, not the other way around. The College of Social Work is aware of the danger of conflating correlation and causation, but they believe that this demographic data will still be worth exploring.)*\n",

    "Note: much of this code used to reside within [census_data_imports_v2.ipynb](https://github.com/kburchfiel/pfn/blob/main/Census_Data_Imports/census_data_imports_v2.ipynb) within my Python for Nonprofits GitHub project. In order to simplify that project, I decided to move that file (along with its corresponding mapping code) into a separate GitHub project."

Meanwhile, married-couple households with kids had a median poverty rate of 6.17% compared to 31.77% for non-married couple households with kids. Therefore, although we can't determine the *direction* of causation within the marriage/poverty relationship using this data alone, it's evident that married households tend to have lower poverty rates than do non-married households.\n",
