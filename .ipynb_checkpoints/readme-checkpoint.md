# Importing and Visualizing Marriage and Poverty Data (Work in Progress)

By Kenneth Burchfiel

This project demonstrates how to import, then map county-level data on poverty rates by marital status. This code used to reside within my [Python for Nonprofits](https://github.com/kburchfiel/pfn) project, but in order to simplify that codebase, I moved it into a standalone document.

This project could use some additional documentation and refactoring; I have some other progamming projects that I'd like to attend to first, but hopefully I can revisit this code (perhaps with an updated ACS dataset) in the future.
